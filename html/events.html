        As an undergrad, I also got several opportunities to expand my network by engaging in different clubs and activities. These clubs and activities 
        were mostly at my college, however, some activities were outside of my college and hosted by top companies. Listed below are the main clubs and 
        activities that I was part of:

            Being a part of nation-wide hackathon was the best part during my undergrad. It was even more special since it was organized by JPMorgan Chase. The goal of the hackathon was to collaborate 
            with peers from different states and come up with a solution for a problem assigned by an Non-Governmental Organization(NGO). Every group should have 24 hours to build something that achieves
            their particular NGO's requirements. Our team(Team 12) basically designed an application for the challenge statement given by an NGO called American Financial Solutions. We made it so that it 
            can help users to get customized quotes based on the details entered in the form. As a whole, the CFG hackathon was a joyous experience for me.

            I was also part of an awesome Computer Science club called ACM. The goal of the ACM club was to collaborate with college peers to solve some of the interesting programming problems. Every Tuesdays or Wednesdays, 
            once a week, I would join their weekly meeting, pair up with other college students, and utilize coding platform like HackerRank to solve programming problems. I was a member of this club for around a year. However,
            this club too was a joyous experience for me. In fact, in terms of my career field, I learned a lot about Computer Science from this club.
